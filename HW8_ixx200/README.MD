# Overview
I try to provide interactive visual insights of building age, energy use, and building configuration using Local Law 84 from 2013-2016 and PLUTO datasets.

# Limitation
There are 9,852 samples in my integrated dataset. However, additional locationing from building address to lat/long was required. Paid Carto feature was required. Only 400 of these samples were rendered due to limited Carto credit for geo conversion.

# Code
Please see the ipython notebook attached. It includes the following steps that generate the visualization dataset:
- data integration and cleaning
- feature engineering
- modelling
- export to CSV for uploading to Carto
