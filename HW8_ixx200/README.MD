# Overview
I try to provide interactive visual insights of building age, energy use, and building configuration using Local Law 84 from 2013-2016 and PLUTO datasets. 

# Visualization

**Caption**: this is a map of 400 NYC buildings from Local Law 84. It highlights areas with older buildings using color coding. Many older buildings scatter near Central Park, midtown Manhattan, and core areas in Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn. Additional information about energy consumption behaviour and building configuration can be found when hover over each sample.

# Limitation
There are 9,852 samples in my integrated dataset. However, additional locationing to convert building address to latitude/longtitude was needed. This required paid Carto feature. Only 400 of these samples were rendered due to limited Carto credit for geo conversion.

# Code
Please see the ipython notebook attached. It includes the following steps that generate the visualization dataset:
- data integration and cleaning
- feature engineering
- modelling
- export to CSV for uploading to Carto
